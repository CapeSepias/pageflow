#### Breaking Changes

- The built-in widget types must now be registered in the host application. To keep existing functionality from previous Pageflow versions, add these lines to `config/initializers/pageflow.rb` in your host application:

```
# Register the built-in widget types.
# You can remove these or add different versions with the same name.
config.widget_types.register(Pageflow::BuiltInWidgetType.navigation, default: true)
config.widget_types.register(Pageflow::BuiltInWidgetType.mobile_navigation, default: true)
config.widget_types.register(Pageflow::BuiltInWidgetType.classic_player_controls, default: true)
config.widget_types.register(Pageflow::BuiltInWidgetType.slim_player_controls)
```

Media stack:

- Switch from `Expires` to `Cache-Control` header for media uploads.
  ([#753](https://github.com/codevise/pageflow/pull/753))

Itâ€™s recommended you update the files currently stored on S3:

```
s3cmd --recursive modify --add-header="Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000" s3://yourbucket/
s3cmd --recursive modify --remove-header=Expires s3://yourbucket/
```

Tread carefully when you do this! As noted in [this StackExchange answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22501465/how-to-add-cache-control-in-aws-s3), we have experienced that some public read permissions were lost after running this script. Test first using just a single object. In the AWS Management Console, you might want to grant public read access on the entire bucket again to be safe.

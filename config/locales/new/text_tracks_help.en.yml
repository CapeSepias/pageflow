          # Text tracks

          Text tracks can be added to video and audio files. Open the
          file setting dialog of a video or audio file by clicking the
          files's "Settings" button in the "Manage files" view and
          switch to the "Text tracks" tab.

          Here you can upload SRT or VTT text track files. Each text
          track has a language, kind and label attribute. The label is
          displayed to the user in the subtitles menu on video and
          audio pages.

          If a video or audio file has text tracks, the user can
          choose to activate them on video or audio pages. Please note
          that text tracks will not be displayed when a video plays as
          a loop in the page background or when an audio file is used
          as background atmo.

          ## Automatic subtitles

          The selection made by the user in the subtitles menu on
          video or audio pages is stored between pages and
          sessions.

          By default the option "Auto" is selected in the subtitles
          menu. A text track to display is then choosen automatically
          according to the following rules:


          * If a file has a text track of kind "translation" in the
            language of the entry, it is displayed as subtitle
            automatically. This is meant for people who are able to
            understand the language of the entry, but not the language
            spoken in the video or audio.

          * If instead the file has a text track of kind "audio
            replacement", it is displayed automatically if the volume
            has been set to mute using the controls in the navigation
            bar. Please note that for technical reasons it is not
            possible to detect if the volume has been set to mute
            outside of the browser or on mobile devices in general.

          ## Default text track

          If the automatic selection described above does not fit your
          needs, you can select a default text track for each video or
          audio page. It will be displayed if the user has not
          selected a text track from the subtitles menu.

          Open the files tab of the page and choose a default text
          track from the conext menu available via the menu button
          inside the video or audio file field.

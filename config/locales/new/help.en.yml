            ## Title of the Pageflow

            Here you can choose a title for your Pageflow. It will be
            shown on the title bar of the browser window. It also acts
            as an indicator for search engines once the report is
            published.

            ## Language

            Decide in which language your Pageflow should be displayed. This refers to the frontend text such as multimedia tips, scroll-indicators, the overview and the legal notice.

            ## Credits
            Here you can enter your imprint information in free text. In addition, image rights can be assigned for all files under "Manage files", which are then automatically displayed in the imprint.

            ## Social Sharing Picture

            Choose a picture, which should be shown, if your Pageflow is
            shared in social networks.

            ## Summary

            Here you can write a description, which is shown, when your
            Pageflow is shared in social networks.

            ## Social Sharing URL

            If contributions are embedded in your own web pages (with
            a different URL), you can specify an individual URL here
            that is to be used when sharing the contribution.

            ## Social Share Links

            Determine which share buttons should be displayed when
            clicking on the "Share function".
